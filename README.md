A game made in godot about differing perspectives. A portfolio project hopefully showcasing a lot of the skills I've learned as a game developer. The file `references.txt` contains all of the assets I have used from 3rd part sources. THe game is closer to a prototype, with multiple ways to get stuck and a lot of the puzzles being not great. I still think its fun how this project turned out though.
